# NFTMarketplace
> Released on March 10th, 2024 at ETH Oxford Hackathon

## Intro
Decentralisation is coming to a new stage of power and scalability

And we shall embrace the prospects it brings
## Project
This application is a marketplace to buy, store and sell NFTs

It is a Hardhat based project connected to Presto using the "leopardwest" network and deployed on Gateway software

## Scenario of usage
To deploy a fully functional project follow these steps in the [guide](https://docs-presto.gateway.fm/overview):
- Create a rollup
- Download a hardhat configuration file
- [Connect](https://docs-presto.gateway.fm/overview/features-for-developers/how-to-use-hardhat-with-presto) the network to the project 
- Deploy the smart contract

Connect your wallet on the website and select the network of your rollup on your account

Follow the faucet link to request 1 ETH on this network (paste your account address in the input field)

On the platform of the deployed contract now explore the functionality of the contract (Read and Write sections). You will be able to:
- Add a new NFT to the marketplace or to your own collection
- View your NFTs, set a price and put on a market a chosen NFT
- Buy NFTs available on the market

> All the transaction are powered with Metamask
